dbus-mqtt-flashmq-plugin
=========

A plugin that turns FlashMQ into a dbus aware MQTT broker. It also supports receiving requests to change values on the local D-Bus. It's a faster replacement for the original Python dbus-mqtt. And, because it integrated with FlashMQ's event loop, it can coordinate dbus and mqtt activity as efficiently as possible.

FlashMQ with this plugin will run as a service on [Venus OS](https://github.com/victronenergy/venus/wiki). It's currently still in testing, so not available in the GUI. See [Replace Mosquitto with FlashMQ](https://github.com/victronenergy/venus/issues/1098#issuecomment-1576458790) how to enable it. Once part of mainstream Venus, it will be like before: by default it is disabled. To enable,
go to Settings -> Services -> MQTT on the menus of the GX device.

Dbus-mqtt-plugin runs inside FlashMQ running on the GX device itself. That broker will be
accessible on the local network at TCP port 1883. Furthermore the broker is configured to forward all
communication to the central Victron MQTT broker (see the broker URL section for the Victron MQTT broker URL), which allows you to monitor and
control your CCGX over the internet. You'll need your VRM credentials to access this broker. See 'Connecting
to the Victron MQTT server' below.

Building
--------
Once the Venus SDK is active, it's a simple matter of:

```
mkdir build
cmake [-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release] /path/to/project/root
make
```

Set-up
------
Starting from CCGX version 1.70, dbus-mqtt is installed by default, but is not enabled. You can enable it in
Settings->Services.

Notifications
-------------

When a value on the D-Bus changes, the plugin will initiate a publish. The MQTT topic looks like this:

```
N/<portal ID>/<service_type>/<device instance>/<D-Bus path>
```

* Portal ID is the VRM portal ID associated with the CCGX. You can find the portal ID on the CCGX in
  Settings->VRM online portal->VRM Portal ID. On the VRM portal itself, you can find the ID in Settings
  tab.
* Service type is the part of the D-Bus service name that describes the service.
* Device instance is a number used to make all services of the same type unique (this value is published
  on the D-Bus as /DeviceInstance).

The payload of the D-Bus value is wrapped in a dictionary and converted to json. 

Unlike the previous Python implementation, this plugin no longer causes messages to be retained by the broker, either locally or on the internet. There are fundamental problems with retained messages, that are solved by simply requesting the current topics as needed. See the keepalive secion below.

Example: suppose we have a PV inverter, which reports a total AC power of 936W. The topic of the MQTT message would be:

	Topic: N/e0ff50a097c0/pvinverter/20/Ac/Power
	Payload: {"value": 936}

The value 20 in the topic is the device instance which may be different on other systems.

There are 2 special cases:

* A D-Bus value may be invalid. This happens with values that are not always present. For example: a single
  phase PV inverter will not provide a power value on phase 2. So /Ac/L2/Power is invalid. In that case the
  payload of the MQTT message will be {"value": null}. TODO: it was never 'null', it was empty array. It still is right now.
* A device may disappear from the D-Bus. For example: most PV inverters shut down at night, causing a
  communication breakdown. If this happens a notification will be sent for all topics related to the device.
  The payload will be empty (zero bytes, so no valid JSON).

If you want a roundup of all devices connected to the CCGX subscribe to this topic:

	N/e0ff50a097c0/+/+/ProductId

This also is a convenient way to find out which device instances are used, which comes in handy when there are
multiple devices of the same type present.

**If you try this for the first time on your CCGX, you will probably not get any (immediate) results. Please read the Keep-alive section below to find out why.**

Write requests
--------------

Write requests can be sent to change values on the D-Bus. The format looks like the notification. Instead of
a N, the topic should start with a W. The payload format is identical.

Example: on a Hub-4 system we can change the AC-In setpoint with this message:

```
Topic: W/e0ff50a097c0/vebus/257/Hub4/L1/AcPowerSetpoint
Payload: {"value": -200}
```

Important: do not set the retain flag in write requests, because that would cause the request to be repeated
each time the MQTT-service connects to the broker.

The device instance (in this case 257) of a service usually depends on the communication port used the
connect the device to the CCGX, so it is a good idea to check it before sending write requests. A nice way to
do this is by subscribing to the broker using wildcards.

For example:

```
N/e0ff50a097c0/vebus/+/Hub4/L1/AcPowerSetpoint
```

will get you the list of all registered Multis/Quattros (=vebus services) which have published
/Hub4/L1/AcPowerSetpoint D-Bus path. You can pick the device instance from the topics in the list.

Read requests
-------------

A read request will force the plugin to re-read the current value from the dbus and send a notification
message of a specific D-Bus value. Again the
topic is identical to the notification message itself, except that the first character is a 'R'. Wildcards
in the topic are not supported. The payload will be ignored (it's best to keep it empty).

Example: to retrieve the AC power of our favorite PV inverter we publish:

```
Topic: R/e0ff50a097c0/pvinverter/20/Ac/Power
Payload: empty
```

The script will reply with this message (make sure you subscribe to it):

```
Topic: N/e0ff50a097c0/pvinverter/20/Ac/Power
Payload: {"value": 926}
```

Normally you do not need to use read requests, because most values are published automatically as they
change. For values that don't change often, most notably settings (com.victronenergy.settings on D-Bus),
you will have to use a read request to retrieve the current value.

Keep-alive
----------
In order to avoid a lot of traffic, a keep-alive mechanism exists. It works slightly differently from dbus-mqtt shipped in earlier versions of Venus.

To activate keep-alive, send a read request to `R/<portal ID>/keepalive` (or the legacy `R/<portal ID>/system/0/Serial`). It will send all topics it has, whether the system is alive or not. This is the replacement for retained messages as used by the Python dbus-mqtt. Because messages are no longer retained, if you are subscribing to a path like `N/e0ff50a097c0/+/+/ProductId` to see all products, you must initiate a keep-alive request afterwards to see the values. See the next section.

Keep-alive timeout is 60 seconds. After it expires, `null` values are not published. See the next section about changes in behavior. 

You can specify `{ "keepalive-options" : ["suppress-republish"] }` to forgo sending all topics. If you're merely keeping the installation alive, you can use this to reduce the load and traffic.

For a simple command to activate keep-alive on a Linux system, see the [Notes](#notes) at the end of this section.


### Previous behavior and backwards compatibility

With this new replacement for the Python dbus-mqtt are two important changes:

The first is that messages are no longer published as 'retained'. This caused too much confusion about which topics were still valid and which weren't. Instead, when receiving a keep-alive, the system will simply republish all values. This allows existing clients to see all the topics once they connect and send the keep-alive, whether they are the first, second, third, etc.

A consequence of this, is that after keep-alive timeout, `null` values for all topics will not be sent. Topics with `null` are only sent when devices disappear.

The second change is that selective keep-alive is, at least for now, not supported. The system will simply send all topics when you use `R/<portal ID>/keepalive` together with `["vebus/#", "solarcharger/+/Dc/0/Voltage"]` as payload. The reason is that the system never had the desired effect of reducing load, and with this new faster implementation, it's simply no problem to send all topics. 


### Notes

An easy way to send a periodic keep-alive message without having to do it
manually is to run this command in a separate session and/or terminal window:

    do mosquitto_pub  -h 192.168.8.60 -m '' -t 'R/e0ff50a097c0/keepalive'; while :; do mosquitto_pub  -h 192.168.8.60 -m '{ "keepalive-options" : ["suppress-republish"] }' -t 'R/e0ff50a097c0/keepalive'; sleep 5; done

You will need to install the mosquitto client package. On a Debian or Ubuntu
system this can be done with:

    sudo apt-get install mosquitto_clients


Connecting to the Victron MQTT server
-------------------------------------

If the MQTT service is enabled, the CCGX will forward all notifications from the GX device to the Victron MQTT
servers (see the broker URL section for the correct URL). All communication is encrypted using TLS. You can connect to the MQTT
server using your VRM credentials and subscribe to the notifications sent by your GX device. It is also possible
to send read and write requests to the GX device. You can only receive notifications from systems in your own VRM
site list, and to send write requests you need the 'Full Control' permission. This is the default is you have
registered the system yourself. The 'Monitor Only' permission allows subscription to notifications only
(read only access).

A convenient way to test this is using the mosquitto_sub tool, which is part of Mosquitto (on debian linux
you need to install the `mosquitto-clients` package).

Note: because of [this security advisory](https://mosquitto.org/2017/05/security-advisory-cve-2017-7650/), the
client ID and username can't contain the `+`, `#` or `/` characters. Older `mosquitto_pub` and `mosquitto_sub`
auto-generate the client ID with a `/` in it, so they need to be overridden. The `-I myclient_` takes care
of that.

This command will get you the total system consumption:

```
mosquitto_sub -v -I myclient_ -c -t 'N/e0ff50a097c0/system/0/Ac/Consumption/Total/Power' -h <broker_url> -u <email> -P <passwd> --cafile venus-ca.crt -p 8883
```

You may need the full path to the cert file. On the CCGX it is in
`/etc/ssl/certs/ccgx-ca.pem`. You can also find the certificate in this repository as `venus-ca.crt`.

In case you do not receive the value you expect, please read the keep-alive section.

If you have Full Control permissions on the VRM site, write requests will also be processed. For example:

```
mosquitto_pub -I myclient_ -t 'W/e0ff50a097c0/hub4/0/AcPowerSetpoint' -m '{"value":-100}' -h <broker_url> -u <email> -P <passwd> --cafile venus-ca.crt -p 8883
```

Again: do not set the retain flag when sending write requests.

Determining the broker URL for a given installation
---------------------------------------------------
To allow broker scaling, each installation connects to one of 128 available broker hostnames. To determine the hostname of the broker for an installation, you can either request it from the VRM API, or use an alghorithm.

For the VRM API, see the [documentation for listing a user's installations](https://vrm-api-docs.victronenergy.com/#/operations/users/idUser/installations). Each site has a field `mqtt_webhost` and `mqtt_host`. Be sure to add `?extended=1` to the API URL. So, for instance: `https://vrmapi.victronenergy.com/v2/users/<myuserid>/installations?extended=1`.

If it's preferred to calculate it yourself, you can use this alghorithm:

- the `ord()` value of each charachter of the VRM portal ID should be summed.
- the modulo of the sum and 128 determines the broker index number
- the broker URL then is: `mqtt<broker_index>.victronenergy.com`, e.g.: `mqtt101.victronenergy.com`
- the same goes for the websocket host: `webmqtt<broker_index>.victronenergy.com`

An example implementation of this algorithm in Python is:

```python
def _get_vrm_broker_url(self):
    sum = 0
    for character in self._system_id.lower().strip():
        sum += ord(character)
    broker_index = sum % 128
    return "mqtt{}.victronenergy.com".format(broker_index)
```
